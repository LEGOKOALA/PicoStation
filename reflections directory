Alec: I feel like I was much more comfortable in c# this year, with the exception of class parameters. I felt like there was some things I overcomplicated that had much easier solutions, but I feel that I overall understood what I was doing.


JJ: This unit I felt better at reading C# and understanding what some of it means but I cannot code it. There was many days when I felt that chat gpt was my biggest problem and help. It took me awhile to think of a good UI.


Nicholas: I was more comfortable with C# compared to last project, but still have a lot to try to understand and learn. I feel that the multiplayer was a fun challenge, but i ended up figuring everything out.


mary lynn: Since C# is a new language is was definitely not as easy to understand so I took a lot of time trying to understand how it works and getting help from teamates. Took kind of long trying to make blakcout and gravity inversion as i had many bugs and was slowly starting to understand what i was doing along the project.
